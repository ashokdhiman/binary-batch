Q1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Ans: The conditional operators in Java include the Ternary Operator (?:), which is used to return a value based on a condition. This operator is a shorthand for the if-else statement, allowing you to assign values based on a condition.

Q2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Ans: Operators in Java can be classified based on the number of operands they work with:
Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand.
Binary Operators: Operate on two operands.
Ternary Operators: Operate on three operands.

Q3. What is the use of Switch Case in Java programming?
Ans: The switch statement is used to execute one out of multiple code blocks based on the value of an expression. It is an alternative to using multiple if-else statements when there are multiple conditions to check.

Q4. What are the priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java?
Ans: The priority levels of arithmetic operations in Java, from highest to lowest, are as follows:
Parentheses ()
Unary operators like ++, --, +, -
Multiplication *, Division /, and Modulus %
Addition + and Subtraction -

Q5. What are the Conditional Statements and the use of conditional statements in Java?
Ans: Conditional statements in Java include if, if-else, else if, and switch. These statements are used to control the flow of the program based on conditions, allowing decisions to be made dynamically during execution.

Q6. What is the syntax of if-else statement?
Ans: The syntax of an if-else statement in Java is as follows:

if (condition) {
    // Block of code if condition is true
} else {
    // Block of code if condition is false
}

Q7. What are the 3 types of iterative statements in Java?
Ans: The three types of iterative statements (loops) in Java are:
for loop
while loop
do-while loop

Q8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop:
Ans:
For loop: The condition is checked before the loop is executed, and if the condition is false, the loop does not run.
Do-while loop: The condition is checked after the loop has executed at least once, ensuring that the loop runs at least once regardless of the condition.

Q9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10:
Ans:
The program would use a loop to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 10 and print each number.
public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
